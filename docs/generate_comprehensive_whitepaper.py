    for each trade opportunity.
    
    <b>Decision-Making Process:</b> The Ghost Trader uses Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian inference, and decision 
    trees to model potential trade outcomes. It generates thousands of simulated price paths based on historical 
    volatility patterns and current market conditions, then evaluates the performance of the proposed trading 
    strategy across these paths.
    
    <b>Learning Mechanism:</b> Through reinforcement learning from simulated outcomes, the Ghost Trader continuously 
    refines its simulation parameters and risk assessment capabilities. It maintains a database of simulation-to-reality 
    discrepancies, allowing it to calibrate its models for improved accuracy over time.
    
    <b>Interaction Dynamics:</b> The Ghost Trader works closely with the Risk Manager to establish appropriate risk 
    parameters, the Memory Node to incorporate historical patterns, and the Entry/Exit Logic to optimize trade timing.

    encodes trading scenarios, market conditions, and outcomes as high-dimensional vectors (typically 10,000+ dimensions). 
    This approach enables efficient storage and similarity-based retrieval of relevant experiences.
    
    <b>Memory Formation and Decay:</b> The system employs both episodic memory (specific trading events) and semantic 
    memory (generalized patterns) with dynamic reinforcement and decay mechanisms. Successful trading patterns are 
    strengthened through repeated exposure, while unsuccessful or outdated patterns gradually decay.
    
    <b>Contextual Awareness:</b> Unlike simple pattern-matching systems, the Memory Node maintains awareness of the
