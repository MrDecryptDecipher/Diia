### 5. Mathematical Models
- Quantum-inspired price prediction

  - Hilbert space mapping of market states
  - Quantum amplitude estimation
  - Mathematical formulation:
    ```
    |ψ(t)⟩ = ∑ᵢ αᵢ(t)|i⟩
    ```
    where |ψ(t)⟩ represents the quantum state at time t, αᵢ(t) are complex probability amplitudes, and |i⟩ are basis states representing different price levels.

- Hyperdimensional computing for pattern recognition
  - High-dimensional vector operations
  - Binding and bundling operations
  - Similarity metrics in high-dimensional spaces
  - Mathematical formulation:
    ```
    M = ∑ᵢ φ(xᵢ) ⊗ φ(yᵢ)
    ```
    where M is the memory matrix, φ is the encoding function, and ⊗ is the binding operation.

- Zero-loss enforcement mechanism
  - Dynamic stop-loss adjustment
  - Profit-taking optimization
  - Risk-reward calculation
  - Mathematical formulation:
    ```
    SL(t) = Entry - max(ATR(t) × f, Entry - Exit(t-1))
    ```
    where SL(t) is the stop-loss level at time t, ATR is the Average True Range, f is a scaling factor, and Exit(t-1) is the previous exit level.

- Position sizing algorithm
  - Kelly criterion adaptation
  - Volatility-adjusted position sizing
  - Confidence-weighted allocation
  - Mathematical formulation:
    ```
    Size = (Capital × Risk% × Confidence) / (ATR × Multiplier)
    ```
    where Size is the position size, Risk% is the percentage of capital risked per trade, Confidence is the confidence score from the prediction model, ATR is the Average True Range, and Multiplier is a scaling factor.

- Capital growth model
  - Compound growth with zero-loss constraint
  - Reinvestment optimization
  - Drawdown minimization
  - Mathematical formulation:
    ```
    C(t) = C₀ × ∏ᵢ₌₁ᵗ (1 + Rᵢ × (1 - Lᵢ))
    ```
    where C(t) is the capital at time t, C₀ is the initial capital, Rᵢ is the return for trade i, and Lᵢ is the loss factor for trade i (ideally approaching zero).
