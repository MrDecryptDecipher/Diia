For the OMNI trading project, implement a comprehensive quantum-enhanced trading system with the following specifications:

**PROJECT EXPLORATION & UNDERSTANDING:**
1. Execute `tree -a -L 5 /home/ubuntu/Sandeep/projects/omni/` to map the complete project structure and identify all available components, modules, and configuration files
2. Use the codebase-retrieval tool to understand existing trading infrastructure, API integrations, and quantum analysis components before implementation
3. Reference Bybit documentation files:
   - `/home/ubuntu/Sandeep/projects/omni/bybitdocumentations.md`
   - `/home/ubuntu/Sandeep/projects/omni/bybitdemodocumentation.md`
4. Locate and examine demo credentials at `/home/ubuntu/Sandeep/projects/omni/demo.env`

**CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL - EXACT REQUIREMENTS):**
- Total available capital: Exactly 12.00 USDT (never use 100 USDT or other amounts)
- Minimum profit target: 0.6 USDT per trade after all fees and slippage
- Capital allocation: Dynamically distribute the 12 USDT across 3-5 selected assets using confidence-weighted allocation
- Reserve allocation: Keep 2 USDT unallocated as safety buffer (10 USDT actively tradeable)
- Order sizing: Ensure each trade respects Bybit's 5 USDT minimum order requirement

**ASSET SELECTION & SCANNING:**
1. Scan ALL available linear futures on Bybit mainnet (target 300+ assets minimum)
2. Filter for assets with:
   - Low notional value requirements (avoid BTC due to capital constraints)
   - High volatility (minimum 2% daily range)
   - Sufficient liquidity (minimum $1M daily volume)
   - Compatible with 50-100x leverage
3. Prioritize assets where 0.5-0.8% price movements generate 0.6+ USDT profit with leverage

**TRADING EXECUTION SPECIFICATIONS:**
- Leverage range: 50x to 100x (dynamically selected based on volatility)
- Target price movements: 0.5% to 0.8% for profit capture
- Trading frequency: 750+ trades per day (approximately 1 trade every 115 seconds)
- Win rate target: 85-90% successful trades
- Data source: Bybit mainnet for analysis
- Execution environment: Bybit demo/testnet ONLY

**ADVANCED ANALYSIS INTEGRATION (USE EXISTING OMNI COMPONENTS):**
1. Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, Williams %R
2. Chart pattern recognition: Head & shoulders, triangles, flags, pennants
3. Candlestick analysis: Doji, hammer, engulfing patterns, morning/evening stars
4. Machine learning models: LSTM, Random Forest, SVM for price prediction
5. Quantum algorithms: Quantum entanglement correlation mapping, Bell state configurations
6. Market microstructure: Order book imbalance analysis, tick-level data processing
7. Sentiment analysis: News sentiment, social media indicators, fear/greed index

**MANDATORY SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:**
1. **Decision Engine**: Log detailed rationale for each asset selection/rejection with confidence scores
2. **Capital Allocator**: Provide exact USDT breakdown per trade with mathematical precision
3. **Risk Manager**: Implement 0.25% stop-loss, 0.6 USDT take-profit, maximum 0.9% drawdown
4. **Execution Engine**: Generate verifiable Bybit demo order IDs and position confirmations
5. **Performance Tracker**: Maintain rolling 6-session memory with trade attribution
6. **Adaptive Learning**: Update strategy parameters based on performance feedback

**RISK CONTROLS & SAFETY MEASURES:**
- Maximum single trade risk: 0.25% of total capital
- Asset cooldown period: 15 minutes between trades on same asset
- Confidence threshold: Reject trades below 75% confidence score
- Performance audit: Review strategy every 50 trades
- Emergency stop: Halt trading if drawdown exceeds 0.9%

**VALIDATION & PROOF REQUIREMENTS:**
- Provide actual Bybit demo order IDs for each executed trade
- Show position data with entry/exit prices and P&L calculations
- Demonstrate mathematical accuracy of capital allocation (must sum to exactly 12 USDT)
- Validate that minimum order sizes are respected
- Confirm trades generate minimum 0.6 USDT profit after fees

**IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:**
1. First, thoroughly explore existing OMNI codebase to identify reusable components
2. Integrate with existing quantum analysis modules rather than recreating them
3. Build upon existing Bybit API integration infrastructure
4. Leverage existing risk management and portfolio optimization components
5. Use existing machine learning and pattern recognition modules

**SUCCESS VALIDATION CRITERIA:**
- System successfully scans 300+ Bybit assets in real-time
- Generates verifiable demo trades with order IDs and position data
- Maintains 85-90% win rate over 100+ trades
- Achieves 0.6+ USDT profit per trade after all costs
- Demonstrates exponential capital growth through compounding
- Shows comprehensive utilization of OMNI project components

The implementation must leverage the complete existing OMNI architecture and demonstrate actual trade execution capability, not just theoretical analysis.
