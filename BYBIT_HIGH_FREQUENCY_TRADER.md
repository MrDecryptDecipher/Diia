## Implementation Details

### Dual-Direction Trading (LONG and SHORT)

The system implements both LONG and SHORT positions to capitalize on all market movements:

```rust
// Generate LONG signal (buy)
let long_signal = (
    // Condition 1: RSI oversold + MACD bullish + price below lower BB
    (rsi_14 < 30.0 && macd_line > signal_line && current_price < lower_band) ||
    // Condition 2: Strong bullish momentum with confirmation
    (macd_line > signal_line && macd_line > 0 &&
     candles.windows(3).last().map_or(false, |w| w[0].close < w[1].close && w[1].close < w[2].close)) ||
    // Condition 3: Quantum predictor strongly bullish
    (prediction.confidence > 85.0 && prediction.price_4h > current_price * 1.01)
);

// Generate SHORT signal (sell)
let short_signal = (
    // Condition 1: RSI overbought + MACD bearish + price above upper BB
    (rsi_14 > 70.0 && macd_line < signal_line && current_price > upper_band) ||
    // Condition 2: Strong bearish momentum with confirmation
    (macd_line < signal_line && macd_line < 0 &&
     candles.windows(3).last().map_or(false, |w| w[0].close > w[1].close && w[1].close > w[2].close)) ||
    // Condition 3: Quantum predictor strongly bearish
    (prediction.confidence > 85.0 && prediction.price_4h < current_price * 0.99)
);
```

### Exact Capital Management

The system maintains exactly $12 USDT capital for each trade:

```rust
// CRITICAL: Ensure we're always working with exactly 12 USDT capital
// This is a hard requirement - we must maintain exactly 12 USDT for each trade
let exact_capital = 12.0;

// Calculate fees based on asset's specific fee rate
let entry_fee = exact_capital * metadata.fee_rate;
let exit_fee = exact_capital * metadata.fee_rate;
let total_fees = entry_fee + exit_fee;

// Calculate funding rate cost (if position is held for 8 hours)
let funding_rate_cost = exact_capital * metadata.funding_rate * 8.0 / 24.0;

// Calculate total costs
let total_costs = total_fees + funding_rate_cost;
```

### Exact Leverage Calculation

The system calculates the exact leverage needed to achieve $2 USDT profit per trade:

```rust
// Calculate required price movement percentage to achieve 2 USDT profit
// Formula: (required_profit + total_costs) / (capital * leverage) = required_movement
// Solve for leverage: leverage = (required_profit + total_costs) / (capital * required_movement)

// We'll target a 0.5% price movement which is achievable in short timeframes
let target_price_movement = 0.005; // 0.5%

// Calculate the exact leverage needed
let required_leverage = (self.min_profit_per_trade + total_costs) / (exact_capital * target_price_movement);

// Ensure leverage doesn't exceed asset's maximum allowed leverage
let leverage = required_leverage.min(metadata.max_leverage);
```

### Exact Take-Profit and Stop-Loss Calculation

The system calculates the exact take-profit level to achieve $2 USDT profit and implements a sophisticated stop-loss to prevent any losses:

```rust
// Calculate EXACT take profit price to achieve 2 USDT profit
let take_profit = match opportunity.action.as_str() {
    "buy" => {
        // For long positions: entry_price * (1 + (profit_target + fees) / (position_size * leverage))
        opportunity.price * (1.0 + (self.min_profit_per_trade + total_costs) / (position_value * leverage))
    },
    "sell" => {
        // For short positions: entry_price * (1 - (profit_target + fees) / (position_size * leverage))
        opportunity.price * (1.0 - (self.min_profit_per_trade + total_costs) / (position_value * leverage))
    },
    _ => opportunity.price,
};

// Calculate stop loss price - CRITICAL for zero loss enforcement
let stop_loss = match opportunity.action.as_str() {
    "buy" => {
        // For long positions, calculate exact breakeven price including fees
        let breakeven = opportunity.price * (1.0 + (total_costs / (position_value * leverage)));
        // Set stop loss slightly below breakeven
        breakeven * 0.999
    },
    "sell" => {
        // For short positions, calculate exact breakeven price including fees
        let breakeven = opportunity.price * (1.0 - (total_costs / (position_value * leverage)));
        // Set stop loss slightly above breakeven
        breakeven * 1.001
    },
    _ => opportunity.price,
};
```

### Intelligent Trade Distribution

To achieve exactly 750 trades per day, the system uses a sophisticated trade distribution algorithm:

```rust
// CRITICAL: Calculate EXACT timing to achieve 750 trades per day
// We need to distribute trades evenly throughout the day
let seconds_in_day = 86400; // 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds
let seconds_remaining_in_day = seconds_in_day - (current_time % seconds_in_day) as usize;

// Calculate how many trades we still need to execute today
let trades_remaining = self.target_trades_per_day.saturating_sub(self.trades_today);

// Calculate the exact interval between trades to achieve our target
let seconds_per_trade = if trades_remaining > 0 {
    // Distribute remaining trades evenly across remaining time
    seconds_remaining_in_day / trades_remaining
} else {
    // We've already met our target for today
    3600 // Default to 1 hour if we've already met our target
};
```

## Performance Monitoring
