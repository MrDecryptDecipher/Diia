# 🎯 ACTUAL Bybit Demo Trading - Step by Step Guide

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: This is REAL Trading on Demo Account

This guide will help you set up and run **ACTUAL trades** on Bybit's demo/testnet environment. The trades are **REAL** - they just use demo money instead of real money.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Bybit Account** (free to create)
2. **Demo API Keys** from Bybit testnet
3. **Rust** installed on your system
4. **Internet connection** for API calls

## 🚀 Step 2: Automated Setup

```

### Build the System
