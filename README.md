# 🚀 OMNI-ALPHA VΩ∞∞ Trading System

A self-evolving, AI-governed, sovereign trading intelligence system designed to operate as a capital-autonomous, no-loss, multi-agent AI economy.

## 🌟 Overview

The OMNI-ALPHA VΩ∞∞ Trading System is a sophisticated trading platform that uses advanced AI techniques to trade cryptocurrencies. The system starts with exactly 12 USDT and aims to:

- 💰 Generate at least 2.2 USDT profit per trade
- 🔄 Execute approximately 750 trades per day
- 📈 Grow capital exponentially through intelligent trading strategies
- 🧠 Self-evolve and improve over time
- 🛡️ Implement zero-loss guarantee mechanisms
- 🔮 Utilize quantum-inspired prediction algorithms
- 🧩 Employ neural networks for pattern recognition
- 👥 Coordinate multiple specialized trading agents

## 🧩 Key Components

- **Zero Loss Enforcer**: Ensures no trades result in a loss
- **God Kernel**: Evolves trading strategies over time
- **Memory Node**: Stores and analyzes trade history
- **Compound Controller**: Manages capital allocation and growth
- **Ghost Trader**: Simulates trades before execution
- **Anti-Loss Hedger**: Implements hedging strategies
- **Quantum Predictor**: Uses quantum-inspired algorithms for price prediction
- **Neural Interface**: Visualizes system performance and market data
- **Trading System**: Coordinates all components and executes trades
- **Market Simulator**: Backtests strategies with historical data
- **Bybit Exchange Adapter**: Connects to Bybit for live trading

## 🔌 Bybit Demo Integration

The system is integrated with Bybit Demo Trading, using the following endpoints:

- REST API: `https://api-demo.bybit.com`
- WebSocket: `wss://stream-demo.bybit.com`

### 🔑 API Permissions

The API key has the following permissions:

- Contracts - Orders Positions
- USDC Contracts - Trade
- Unified Trading - Trade
- SPOT - Trade
- Wallet - Account Transfer, Subaccount Transfer
- Exchange - Convert, Exchange History Read-Only

These permissions allow the system to trade across all major account types and manage wallet transfers.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Dashboard Frontend**: A React-based UI for monitoring system performance
2. **API Server**: Express.js backend for handling API requests
3. **WebSocket Server**: Real-time data streaming
4. **gRPC Server**: High-performance communication between system components
5. **Trading Strategy Service**: Core trading logic with multiple strategies
6. **Agent Orchestrator**: Coordinates multiple specialized trading agents
7. **Quantum Bridge**: Quantum-inspired prediction algorithms
8. **Zero Loss Guarantee**: Ensures minimum profit per trade

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd ui/dashboard-backend
   npm install
   cd ../dashboard
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables in ecosystem.config.js files
4. Run the start script:
   ```
   ./start-omni.sh
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system is configured through the ecosystem.config.js files in both the backend and frontend directories. Key configuration parameters include:

- Bybit API credentials
- Initial capital (12 USDT)
- Minimum profit per trade (2.2 USDT)
- Target trades per day (750)
- Server ports:
  - Frontend: 10001
  - API Server: 10002
  - WebSocket Server: 10003
  - gRPC Server: 10004

## 📊 Monitoring

The system can be monitored through:

1. **Dashboard UI**: http://3.111.22.56:10001
2. **PM2 Logs**: `pm2 logs`
3. **Metrics API**: http://3.111.22.56:10002/api/metrics
4. **WebSocket**: Real-time updates at ws://3.111.22.56:10003

## 💡 Capital Genesis Logic

The system starts with $12 USDT and uses the following principles:

1. Zero-Loss Enforcement: No trade is allowed to result in a loss
2. Recursive Intelligence: The system learns from each trade and improves over time
3. Multi-Agent Collaboration: Different agents work together to make trading decisions
4. Quantum Prediction: Advanced algorithms predict price movements
5. Compound Growth: Profits are reinvested to accelerate capital growth
