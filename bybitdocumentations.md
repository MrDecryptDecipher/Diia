Introduction
Overview
The V5 API brings uniformity and efficiency to Bybit's product lines, unifying Spot, Derivatives, and Options in one set of specifications.

Current API Coverage
OpenAPI Version	Account Type	Linear	Inverse	Spot	Options
USDT Perpetual	USDC Perpetual	USDC Futures	Perpetual	Futures
V5	Unified trading account	‚úì	‚úì	‚úì	‚úì	‚úì	‚úì	‚úì
Classic account	‚úì			‚úì	‚úì	‚úì	
Key Upgrades
Product Lines Alignment
V5 unifies the APIs of various trading products into one, providing users the capability to trade Spot, Derivatives and Options contracts with a single API by distinguishing transactions through different order parameters. Consequently, there is no need to switch between multiple interfaces when building different products ‚Äì regardless of tasks such as order management or querying wallet data ‚Äì as the same API can be used to request and return results.

The global dictionary in V5 is uniquely defined to avoid scenarios where different terms are used for the same purposes, or where a single term has multiple references. This simplifies the troubleshooting process for users.

For example, when creating an order with POST V5/order/create, users can specify category=spot/linear/inverse/option to create multiple orders across different products.

Enhance Capital Efficiency
V5 provides users the ability to upgrade accounts to a unified account, allowing for sharing and cross-utilization of funds across Spot, USDT Perpetual, USDC Perpetual and Options contracts. Users are also able to offset profit and losses across different positions, thus further enhancing capital efficiency.

Unified Account Borrowing
API V5 supports borrowing across a unified account mode. Users can pledge multiple assets as collateral to obtain margin for trading across different products.

For example: Trader Alice opens a USDT-settled BTCUSDT contract position while holding only BTC assets. If a floating loss is incurred, a debt will be recorded and interest will be charged hourly.

Portfolio Margin Mode
Unified Accounts now support combined margin between Inverse Perpetuals, Inverse Futures, USDT Perpetual, USDC Perpetual, USDC Futures and Options.

API Interface Naming Standard
API V5 offers clearer path definitions for improved clarity and reduced ambiguity. The new version divides the API path into market data, order management, position management, account management, asset management, and more modules.

{host}/{version}/{product}/{module}
Example: api.bybit.com/v5/market/recent-trade

Address Segment	Description
v5/market/	Candlestick, orderbook, ticker, platform transaction data, underlying financial rules, risk control rules
v5/order/	Order management
v5/position/	Position management
v5/account/	Single account operations only ‚Äì unified funding account, rates, etc.
v5/asset/	Operations across multiple accounts ‚Äì asset management, fund management, etc.
v5/spot-lever-token/	Obtain quotes from Leveraged Tokens on Spot, and to exercise purchase and redeem functions
v5/spot-margin-trade/	Manage Margin Trading on Spot
Cancellation of Orders by Settlement Currency
Users can cancel all Derivatives orders settled by the same currency with settleCoin.

Addition of Insurance Fund Interface
This interface addition allows for queries of the insurance pool, which users can use to check for any insurance fund updates on the Bybit platform.

Readability Improvements to API Documentation
The API documentation has been revised and proofread to improve clarity and reduce confusion. Any parts of the previous documentation that were not clear have been revised to provide better explanations.

Authentication
info
Please visit Bybit's testnet or mainnet to generate an API key

REST API Base Endpoint:

Testnet:
https://api-testnet.bybit.com
Mainnet (both endpoints are available):
https://api.bybit.com
https://api.bytick.com
important
Netherland users: use https://api.bybit.nl for mainnet
Hong Kong users: use https://api.byhkbit.com for mainnet
Turkey users: use https://api.bybit-tr.com for mainnet
Kazakhstan users: use https://api.bybit.kz for mainnet
Bybit cannot promise the stability and performance if you are still using api.bybit.com, and this domain has the possibility to be shutdown at any time for users from these countries/areas.
Select Your API Key Type
System-generated API Keys: The API key generated by the Bybit system operates with HMAC encryption. You will be provided with a pair of public and private keys. Please treat this pair of keys as passwords and keep them safe.

Follow HMAC sample scripts to complete encryption procedures.

Auto-generated API Keys: Self-generated API keys operate with RSA encryption. You must create your public and private keys through the software, and then only provide the public key to Bybit, we will never hold your private key.

Use api-rsa-generator to create RSA private and public keys
Follow the RSA sample scripts to complete encryption procedures.
Parameters for Authenticated Endpoints
The following HTTP header keys must be used for authentication:

X-BAPI-API-KEY - API key
X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP - UTC timestamp in milliseconds
X-BAPI-SIGN - a signature derived from the request's parameters
X-Referer or Referer - the header for broker users only
We also provide X-BAPI-RECV-WINDOW (unit in millisecond and default value is 5,000) to specify how long an HTTP request is valid. It is also used to prevent replay attacks.

A smaller X-BAPI-RECV-WINDOW is more secure, but your request may fail if the transmission time is greater than your X-BAPI-RECV-WINDOW.

caution
Please make sure that the timestamp parameter adheres to the following rule:
server_time - recv_window <= timestamp < server_time + 1000
which means your timestamp should lie in range: [server_time - recv_window; server_time + 1000)
server_time stands for Bybit server time, which can be queried via the Server Time endpoint. Keep in mind it's highly recommended that you use local device time for timestamp and keep it NTP-synchronized at all times.

Create A Request
tip
To assist in diagnosing advanced network problems, you may consider adding cdn-request-id to your request headers. Its value should be unique for each request.

Basic steps:

Calculate the string you want to sign as follows: For GET requests: timestamp + API key + recv_window + queryString For POST requests: timestamp + API key + recv_window + jsonBodyString
Use the HMAC_SHA256 or RSA_SHA256 algorithm to sign the string in step 1, and convert it to a lowercase HEX string for HMAC_SHA256, or base64 for RSA_SHA256 to obtain the string value of your signature.
Add your signature to X-BAPI-API-KEY header send the HTTP request. You can refer to examples below for more info
info
Example signature algorithms can be found here.
An example for how to generate plain text to encrypt

GET
POST
# rule:
timestamp+api_key+recv_window+queryString

# example values:
timestamp = "1658384314791"
api_key = "XXXXXXXXXX"
recv_window = "5000"
queryString = "category=option&symbol=BTC-29JUL22-25000-C"

# resulting string that needs to be signed:
"1658384314791XXXXXXXXXX5000category=option&symbol=BTC-29JUL22-25000-C"

# resulting example signature for HMAC:
"410e0f387bafb7afd0f1722c068515e09945610124fa11774da1da857b72f30b"

3: https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/acct-mode:
Different Account Modes
Different Account Modes
There are currently three account modes existing on the Bybit platform, namely classic account, unified account 1.0, and unified account 2.0.

UTA 2.0
This account mode is the ultimate version of the unified account, integrating inverse contracts, USDT perpetual, USDT Futures, USDC perpetual, USDC Futures, spot and options into a unified trading system. In cross margin and portifolio margin modes, margin is shared among all trades.

uta2.0

UTA 1.0
Under this account mode, inverse contract transactions are in a separate trading account, and the corresponding margin currency needs to be deposited into the "inverse derivatives account" before trading, and the margins are not shared between each other. For USDT perpetual, USDT Futures, USDC perpetual, USDC Futures, spot and options are all traded within the "unified trading"

uta1.0

Classic Account
Under this account mode, contract transactions and spot transactions are separated. Inverse contracts and USDT perpetual transactions are completed in the "derivatives account", and spot transactions are completed in the "spot account"

classic

Determine account mode through API
Use the key of the corresponding account to call Get Account Info, look at the field unifiedMarginStatus

1: classic account
3: uta1.0
4: uta1.0 (pro version)
5: uta2.0
6: uta2.0 (pro version)

Self Match Prevention
What is SMP?
With the Self Match Prevention function users can choose the execution method when placing an order. When the counterparty is the same UID or belongs to the same specified SMP group, the execution can be effected accordingly:

Cancel maker: Cancel the maker order when executed; taker order remains.
Cancel taker: Cancel the taker order when executed; maker order remains.
Cancel both: Cancel both taker and maker orders when executed.
How to set SMP?
Check request params of Place Order. Specify parameter smpType when place the order

What is SMP Trade Group?
SMP is available for any user by UID level.
SMP Trade Group Management is only available for institutions at present.
SMP Trade Group: refers to a group of UIDs. When any of the UIDs in this group places an order and the SMP execution policy is selected, it will be triggered when the maker order under any of the UIDs in this group is matched.

More details:

Each UID can only join one SMP Trade Group.

SMP Trade Group is a UID-level management group, so when a main-account joins an SMP Trade Group, all the sub-accounts under this main-account will automatically join the Trade Group as well.

If the main-account has already joined an SMP Trade Group, and a sub-account is created after it, this new sub-account will automatically join the same SMP Trade Group by default.
A sub-account does not have to be tied to the same SMP Trading Group as the main-account. It is only the default behaviour. It can be reset into different groups manually if needed.
The relationship between SMP Trade Group and UIDs can be changed: when a UID joins a new SMP Trade Group or is removed from an SMP Trade Group. This operation will not affect the pre-existing orders, it will only affect the newly placed orders after the relationship has changed.
Notes: Based on this, we strongly suggest that when there will be an SMP Trade Group change, you should cancel all pre-existing orders to avoid an unexpected execution.

The SMP Trade Group has a higher priority on SMP execution, so an individual UID is only taken into account when there is no SMP Trade Group on either side.

Once the order is standing in the orderbook, its SMP flag doesn't matter any more. The system always follows the tag on the latter order.

Examples:
1st of Jan: UID1 joins SMP Trade Group A, and places Order1;
2nd of Jan: UID1 is removed from SMP Trade Group A, but Order1 is still active and "New"

case1: If UID1 joined SMP Trade Group B, and placed Order2, if Order2 meets Order1, it will be executed since they belong to two different groups.
case2: If UID1 did not join any other groups after being removed from SMP Trade Group A, and placed Order2, if Order2 meets Order1, the SMP will be triggered because UID1 did not have a group when it placed Order2, so SMP was triggered at the UID level (the same UID1).
How to manage my UIDs & SMP Trade Group?

Demo Trading Service
Introduction
Bybit v5 Open API supports demo trading account, but please note not every API is available for demo trading account because demo trading service is mainly for trading experience purpose, so that it does not have a complete function compared with the real trading service.

Create API Key
You need to log in to your mainnet account;
Switch to Demo Trading, please note it is an independent account for demo trading only, and it has its own user ID;
Hover the mouse on user avatar, then click "API" to generate api key and secret;
Usage rules
Basic trading rules are the same as real trading
Orders generated in demo trading keep 7 days
Default rate limit, not upgradable
Domain
Mainnet Demo Trading URL:
Rest API: https://api-demo.bybit.com
Websocket: wss://stream-demo.bybit.com (note that this only supports the private streams; public data is identical to that found on mainnet with wss://stream.bybit.com; WS Trade is not supported)

Tips
Please note that demo trading is an isolated module. When you create the key from demo trading, please use above domain to connect.
By the way, it is meaningless to use demo trading service in the testnet website, so do not create a key from Testnet demo trading.

Place Order
This endpoint supports to create the order for Spot, Margin trading, USDT perpetual, USDT futures, USDC perpetual, USDC futures, Inverse Futures and Options.

info
Supported order type (orderType):
Limit order: orderType=Limit, it is necessary to specify order qty and price.

Market order: orderType=Market, execute at the best price in the Bybit market until the transaction is completed. When selecting a market order, the "price" can be empty. In the futures trading system, in order to protect traders against the serious slippage of the Market order, Bybit trading engine will convert the market order into an IOC limit order for matching. If there are no orderbook entries within price slippage limit, the order will not be executed. If there is insufficient liquidity, the order will be cancelled. The slippage threshold refers to the percentage that the order price deviates from the mark price. You can learn more here: Adjustments to Bybit's Derivative Trading Price Limit Mechanism
Supported timeInForce strategy:
GTC
IOC
FOK
PostOnly: If the order would be filled immediately when submitted, it will be cancelled. The purpose of this is to protect your order during the submission process. If the matching system cannot entrust the order to the order book due to price changes on the market, it will be cancelled.
RPI: Retail Price Improvement order. Assigned market maker can place this kind of order, and it is a post only order, only match with the order from Web or APP.

How to create a conditional order:
When submitting an order, if triggerPrice is set, the order will be automatically converted into a conditional order. In addition, the conditional order does not occupy the margin. If the margin is insufficient after the conditional order is triggered, the order will be cancelled.

Take profit / Stop loss: You can set TP/SL while placing orders. Besides, you could modify the position's TP/SL.

Order quantity: The quantity of perpetual contracts you are going to buy/sell. For the order quantity, Bybit only supports positive number at present.

Order price: Place a limit order, this parameter is required. If you have position, the price should be higher than the liquidation price. For the minimum unit of the price change, please refer to the priceFilter > tickSize field in the instruments-info endpoint.

orderLinkId: You can customize the active order ID. We can link this ID to the order ID in the system. Once the active order is successfully created, we will send the unique order ID in the system to you. Then, you can use this order ID to cancel active orders, and if both orderId and orderLinkId are entered in the parameter input, Bybit will prioritize the orderId to process the corresponding order. Meanwhile, your customized order ID should be no longer than 36 characters and should be unique.

Open orders up limit:
Perps & Futures:
a) Each account can hold a maximum of 500 active orders simultaneously per symbol.
b) conditional orders: each account can hold a maximum of 10 active orders simultaneously per symbol.
Spot: 500 orders in total, including a maximum of 30 open TP/SL orders, a maximum of 30 open conditional orders for each symbol per account
Option: a maximum of 50 open orders per account

Rate limit:
Please refer to rate limit table. If you need to raise the rate limit, please contact your client manager or submit an application via here

Risk control limit notice:
Bybit will monitor on your API requests. When the total number of orders of a single user (aggregated the number of orders across main account and sub-accounts) within a day (UTC 0 - UTC 24) exceeds a certain upper limit, the platform will reserve the right to remind, warn, and impose necessary restrictions. Customers who use API default to acceptance of these terms and have the obligation to cooperate with adjustments.

Spot Stop Order
Spot supports TP/SL order, Conditional order, however, the system logic is different between classic account and Unified account
classic account: When the stop order is created, you will get an order ID. After it is triggered, you will get a new order ID
Unified account: When the stop order is created, you will get an order ID. After it is triggered, the order ID will not be changed

https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/dcp:
Set Disconnect Cancel All
info
What is Disconnection Protect (DCP)?
Based on the websocket private connection and heartbeat mechanism, Bybit provides disconnection protection function. The timing starts from the first disconnection. If the Bybit server does not receive the reconnection from the client for more than 10 (default) seconds and resumes the heartbeat "ping", then the client is in the state of "disconnection protect", all active futures / spot / option orders of the client will be cancelled automatically. If within 10 seconds, the client reconnects and resumes the heartbeat "ping", the timing will be reset and restarted at the next disconnection.

How to enable DCP
If you need to turn it on/off, you can contact your client manager for consultation and application. The default time window is 10 seconds.

Applicable
Effective for Inverse Perp / Inverse Futures / USDT Perp / USDT Futures / USDC Perp / USDC Futures / Spot / options (UTA2.0)
Effective for USDT Perp / USDT Futures / USDC Perp / USDC Futures / Spot / options (UTA1.0)

tip
After the request is successfully sent, the system needs a certain time to take effect. It is recommended to query or set again after 10 seconds

You can use this endpoint to get your current DCP configuration.
Your private websocket connection must subscribe "dcp" topic in order to trigger DCP successfully

https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/position/position-mode:
Switch Position Mode
It supports to switch the position mode for USDT perpetual and Inverse futures. If you are in one-way Mode, you can only open one position on Buy or Sell side. If you are in hedge mode, you can open both Buy and Sell side positions simultaneously.

tip
Priority for configuration to take effect: symbol > coin > system default
System default: one-way mode
If the request is by coin (settleCoin), then all symbols based on this setteCoin that do not have position and open order will be batch switched, and new listed symbol based on this settleCoin will be the same mode you set.
Example
System default	coin	symbol
Initial setting	one-way	never configured	never configured
Result	All USDT perpetual trading pairs are one-way mode
Change 1	-	-	Set BTCUSDT to hedge-mode
Result	BTCUSDT becomes hedge-mode, and all other symbols keep one-way mode
list new symbol ETHUSDT	ETHUSDT is one-way mode Ôºàinherit default rulesÔºâ
Change 2	-	Set USDT to hedge-mode	-
Result	All current trading pairs with no positions or orders are hedge-mode, and no adjustments will be made for trading pairs with positions and orders
list new symbol SOLUSDT	SOLUSDT is hedge-mode (Inherit coin rule)
Change 3	-	-	Set ASXUSDT to one-mode
Take effect result	AXSUSDT is one-way mode, other trading pairs have no change
list new symbol BITUSDT	BITUSDT is hedge-mode (Inherit coin rule)

https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/position/trading-stop:
Set Trading Stop
Set the take profit, stop loss or trailing stop for the position.

tip
Passing these parameters will create conditional orders by the system internally. The system will cancel these orders if the position is closed, and adjust the qty according to the size of the open position.

info
New version of TP/SL function supports both holding entire position TP/SL orders and holding partial position TP/SL orders.

Full position TP/SL orders: This API can be used to modify the parameters of existing TP/SL orders.
Partial position TP/SL orders: This API can only add partial position TP/SL orders.
note
Under the new version of TP/SL function, when calling this API to perform one-sided take profit or stop loss modification on existing TP/SL orders on the holding position, it will cause the paired tp/sl orders to lose binding relationship. This means that when calling the cancel API through the tp/sl order ID, it will only cancel the corresponding one-sided take profit or stop loss order ID.

https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/account/set-mmp:
Set MMP
info
What is MMP?
Market Maker Protection (MMP) is an automated mechanism designed to protect market makers (MM) against liquidity risks and over-exposure in the market. It prevents simultaneous trade executions on quotes provided by the MM within a short time span. The MM can automatically pull their quotes if the number of contracts traded for an underlying asset exceeds the configured threshold within a certain time frame. Once MMP is triggered, any pre-existing MMP orders will be automatically canceled, and new orders tagged as MMP will be rejected for a specific duration ‚Äî known as the frozen period ‚Äî so that MM can reassess the market and modify the quotes.

How to enable MMP
Send an email to Bybit (financial.inst@bybit.com) or contact your business development (BD) manager to apply for MMP. After processed, the default settings are as below table:

Parameter	Type	Comments	Default value
baseCoin	string	Base coin	BTC
window	string	Time window (millisecond)	5000
frozenPeriod	string	Frozen period (millisecond)	100
qtyLimit	string	Quantity limit	100
deltaLimit	string	Delta limit	100
Applicable
Effective for options only. When you place an option order, set mmp=true, which means you mark this order as a mmp order.

Some points to note
Only maker order qty and delta will be counted into qtyLimit and deltaLimit.
qty_limit is the sum of absolute value of qty of each trade executions. delta_limit is the absolute value of the sum of qty*delta. If any of these reaches or exceeds the limit amount, the account's market maker protection will be triggered.
HTTP Request
POST /v5/account/mmp-modify

Request Parameters
Parameter	Required	Type	Comments
baseCoin	true	string	Base coin, uppercase only
window	true	string	Time window (ms)
frozenPeriod	true	string	Frozen period (ms). "0" means the trade will remain frozen until manually reset
qtyLimit	true	string	Trade qty limit (positive and up to 2 decimal places)
deltaLimit	true	string	Delta limit (positive and up to 2 decimal places)

info
If your account is registered from www.bybit-tr.com, please use stream.bybit-tr.com for mainnet access
If your account is registered from www.bybit.kz, please use stream.bybit.kz for mainnet access
Customise Private Connection Alive Time
For private stream and order entry, you can customise alive duration by adding a param max_active_time, the lowest value is 30s (30 seconds), the highest value is 600s (10 minutes). You can also pass 1m, 2m etc when you try to configure by minute level. e.g., wss://stream-testnet.bybit.com/v5/private?max_active_time=1m.

In general, if there is no "ping-pong" and no stream data sent from server end, the connection will be cut off after 10 minutes. When you have a particular need, you can configure connection alive time by max_active_time.

Since ticker scans every 30s, so it is not fully exact, i.e., if you configure 45s, and your last update or ping-pong is occurred on 2023-08-15 17:27:23, your disconnection time maybe happened on 2023-08-15 17:28:15

Authentication
info
Public topics do not require authentication. The following section applies to private topics only.
Apply for authentication when establishing a connection.

Note: if you're using pybit, bybit-api, or another high-level library, you can ignore this code - as authentication is handled for you.

{
    "req_id": "10001", // optional
    "op": "auth",
    "args": [
        "api_key",
        1662350400000, // expires; is greater than your current timestamp
        "signature"
    ]
}

# based on: https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit/blob/master/pybit/_http_manager.py

import hmac
import json
import time
import websocket

api_key = ""
api_secret = ""

# Generate expires.
expires = int((time.time() + 1) * 1000)

# Generate signature.
signature = str(hmac.new(
    bytes(api_secret, "utf-8"),
    bytes(f"GET/realtime{expires}", "utf-8"), digestmod="sha256"
).hexdigest())

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
    url=url,
    ...
)

# Authenticate with API.
ws.send(
    json.dumps({
        "op": "auth",
        "args": [api_key, expires, signature]
    })
)

caution
Due to network complexity, your may get disconnected at any time. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that you receive WebSocket messages on time:

Keep connection alive by sending the heartbeat packet
Reconnect as soon as possible if disconnected
IP Limits
Do not frequently connect and disconnect the connection.
Do not build over 500 connections in 5 minutes. This is counted per WebSocket domain.
Public channel - Args limits
Regardless of Perpetual, Futures, Options or Spot, for one public connection, you cannot have length of "args" array over 21,000 characters.

Spot can input up to 10 args for each subscription request sent to one connection
Options can input up to 2000 args for a single connection
No args limit for Futures for now
How to Send the Heartbeat Packet

    ]
}

Understanding WebSocket Filters: Unsubscription
You can dynamically subscribe and unsubscribe from topics without unsubscribing from the WebSocket like so:

{
    "op": "unsubscribe",
    "args": [
        "publicTrade.ETHUSD"
    ],
    "req_id": "customised_id"
}

Process snapshot/delta
To process snapshot and delta messages, please follow these rules:

Once you have subscribed successfully, you will receive a snapshot. The WebSocket will keep pushing delta messages every time the orderbook changes. If you receive a new snapshot message, you will have to reset your local orderbook. If there is a problem on Bybit's end, a snapshot will be re-sent, which is guaranteed to contain the latest data.

To apply delta updates:

If you receive an amount that is 0, delete the entry
If you receive an amount that does not exist, insert it
If the entry exists, you simply update the value
See working code examples of this logic in the FAQ.

info
Linear, inverse, spot level 1 data: if 3 seconds have elapsed without a change in the orderbook, a snapshot message will be pushed again, and the field u will be the same as that in the previous message.
Linear, inverse, spot level 1 data has snapshot message only
Response Parameters
Parameter	Type	Comments
topic	string	Topic name
type	string	Data type. snapshot,delta
ts	number	The timestamp (ms) that the system generates the data
data	map	Object
> s	string	Symbol name
> b	array	Bids. For snapshot stream, the element is sorted by price in descending order
>> b[0]	string	Bid price
>> b[1]	string	Bid size
The delta data has size=0, which means that all quotations for this price have been filled or cancelled
> a	array	Asks. For snapshot stream, the element is sorted by price in ascending order
>> a[0]	string	Ask price
>> a[1]	string	Ask size
The delta data has size=0, which means that all quotations for this price have been filled or cancelled
> u	integer	Update ID
Occasionally, you'll receive "u"=1, which is a snapshot data due to the restart of the service. So please overwrite your local orderbook
For level 1 of linear, inverse Perps and Futures, the snapshot data will be pushed again when there is no change in 3 seconds, and the "u" will be the same as that in the previous message
> seq	integer	Cross sequence
You can use this field to compare different levels orderbook data, and for the smaller seq, then it means the data is generated earlier.
cts	number	The timestamp from the match engine when this orderbook data is produced. It can be correlated with T from public trade channel

Categorised Topic: Allow you to listen only to specific category websocket updates
tip
You may receive two orderStatus=Filled messages when the cancel request is accepted but the order is executed at the same time. Generally, one message contains "orderStatus=Filled, rejectReason=EC_NoError", and another message contains "orderStatus=Filled, cancelType=CancelByUser, rejectReason=EC_OrigClOrdIDDoesNotExist". The first message tells you the order is executed, and the second message tells you the followed cancel request is rejected due to order is executed.

Batch Create/Amend/Cancel Order
info
A maximum of 20 orders (option), 20 orders (inverse), 20 orders (linear), 10 orders (spot) can be placed per request. The returned data list is divided into two lists. The first list indicates whether or not the order creation was successful and the second list details the created order information. The structure of the two lists are completely consistent.
Option rate limt instruction: its rate limit is count based on the actual number of request sent, e.g., by default, option trading rate limit is 10 reqs per sec, so you can send up to 20 * 10 = 200 orders in one second.
Perpetual, Futures, Spot rate limit instruction, please check here
The account rate limit is shared between websocket and http batch orders
The ack of batch create/amend/cancel order request indicates that the request is successfully accepted. Please use websocket order stream to confirm the order status

https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/rate-limit:
Rate Limit
IP Limit
HTTP IP limit
You are allowed to send 600 requests within a 5-second window per IP by default. This limit applies to all traffic directed to api.bybit.com, api.bybick.com, and local site hostnames such as api.bybit.kz. If you encounter the error ‚Äú403, access too frequent‚Äù, it indicates that your IP has exceeded the allowed request frequency. In this case, you should terminate all HTTP sessions and wait for at least 10 minutes. The ban will be lifted automatically.

We do not recommend running your application at the very edge of these limits in case abnormal network activity results in an unexpected violation.

Websocket IP limit
Do not establish more than 500 connections within a 5-minute window. This limit applies to all connections directed to stream.bybit.com as well as local site hostnames such as stream.bybit.kz.
Do not frequently connect and disconnect the connection
Do not establish more than 1,000 connections per IP for market data. The connection limits are counted separately for Spot, Linear, Inverse, and Options markets
API Rate Limit
caution
If you receive "retCode": 10006, "retMsg": "Too many visits!" in the JSON response, you have hit the API rate limit.

The API rate limit is based on the rolling time window per second and UID. In other words, it is per second per UID. Every request to the API returns response header shown in the code panel:

X-Bapi-Limit-Status - your remaining requests for current endpoint
X-Bapi-Limit - your current limit for current endpoint
X-Bapi-Limit-Reset-Timestamp - the timestamp indicating when your request limit resets if you have exceeded your rate_limit. Otherwise, this is just the current timestamp (it may not exactly match timeNow).

API Rate Limit Rules For VIPs
info
The values in the table represent the application upper limit of the corresponding level, and do not mean that users at this level will automatically enjoy the corresponding API Rate Limit by default.

instructions for batch endpoints
The batch order endpoint, which includes operations for creating, amending, and canceling, has its own rate limit and does not share it with single requests, e.g., let's say the rate limit of single create order endpoint is 100/s, and batch create order endpoint is 100/s, so in this case, I can place 200 linear orders in one second if I use both endpoints to place orders

When category = linear spot or inverse
API for batch create/amend/cancel order, the frequency of the API will be consistent with the current configuration, but the counting consumption will be consumed according to the actual number of orders. (Number of consumption = number of requests * number of orders included in a single request), and the configuration of business lines is independent of each other.

The batch APIs allows 1-10 orders/request. For example, if a batch order request is made once and contains 5 orders, then the request limit will consume 5.

If part of the last batch of orders requested within 1s exceeds the limit, the part that exceeds the limit will fail, and the part that does not exceed the limit will succeed. For example, in the 1 second, the remaining limit is 5, but a batch request containing 8 orders is placed at this time, then the first 5 orders will be successfully placed, and the 6-8th orders will report an error exceeding the limit, and these orders will fail.
